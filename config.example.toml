[suppress]
# Enable notification suppression when user is viewing the task pane
# When enabled, no notifications are sent if:
# - Windows Terminal is the foreground window
# - User is viewing the tmux session/window/pane where the task is running
enabled = true

[security]
# PowerShell execution policy for running scripts
# Options: Bypass, RemoteSigned, AllSigned
#
# IMPORTANT: WSL scripts require "Bypass" because Windows treats WSL file paths
# (\\wsl.localhost\...) as remote locations. RemoteSigned would require scripts
# to be digitally signed.
#
# Security note: "Bypass" only affects the current PowerShell process and does
# not change your system-wide execution policy.
#
# If you prefer stricter security, you can:
# 1. Sign the PowerShell scripts with a code signing certificate
# 2. Change this to "RemoteSigned" or "AllSigned"
pwsh_execution_policy = "Bypass"
